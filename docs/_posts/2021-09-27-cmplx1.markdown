## Chapter 1: Preliminaries

### Complex differentiation

A few useful terminologies and facts:

- $$\CC$$ is complete, meaning that every Cauchy sequence converges;
- $$\DD$$ denotes the open unit disc;
- Equivalent definitions of *compactness* in $$\CC$$: every open cover has finite subcover $$\iff$$ closed and bounded $$\iff$$ every sequence has a converging subsequence;
- A *region* is a connected open subset of $$\CC$$; 
- A subset of $$\CC$$ is connected if and only if it is simply connected;
- Definition of exp and trigonometric functions:
$$e^z = \exp(z) = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{z^n}{n!}$$,
$$\cos(z) = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}$$,
$$\sin(z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}$$,
$$\sinh(z) = -i\sin(iz)$$, and
$$\cosh(z) = \cos(iz)$$;
- Cantor's intersection theorem: any descending sequence of compact sets $$\Omega_1 \supseteq \Omega_2 \supseteq \dots$$ in $$\CC$$ have nonempty intersection. If their diameters converge to 0, then there is an unique intersection point;
- Extreme value theorem: any continuous function $$f: \CC \to \RR$$ on a compact set $$\Omega$$ attains a bounded maximum and minimum in $$\Omega$$.

For an open set $$\Omega$$, a point $$z_0\in \Omega$$ and a function $$f: \Omega \to \CC$$, we say $$f$$ is holomorphic at $$z_0$$ if the limit

$$\lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0}$$

exists. If it does, call this $$f'(z_0)$$.

It is not hard to show that the sum, product, quotient, and chain rules all hold under this definition.

Using the identification $$\CC \cong \RR^2$$, any complex-valued function $$f$$ may also be viewed as having values in $$\RR^2$$. Taking this view, we can show that if $$f$$ is holomorphic at $$z_0$$, then

$$\begin{equation} \pard{f}{x}(z_0) = f'(z_0) = \frac{1}{i} \pard{f}{y}(z_0). \tag{1} \end{equation}$$

This is the Cauchy-Riemann equation(s).

We can also define the Wirtinger derivatives
$$\pard{}{z} = \frac12 (\pard{}{x} - i\pard{}{y})$$,
$$\pard{}{\bar{z}} = \frac12 (\pard{}{x} + i\pard{}{y})$$. Let $$f = u + iv$$, then using (1), we can summarize:

**Theorem.** If $$f$$ is holomorphic at $$z_0$$, then $$\pard{f}{\bar{z}}(z_0) = 0$$ and $$\pard{f}{z}(z_0) = f'(z_0) = 2\pard{u}{z}(z_0)$$. In addition, viewing $$f$$ as a map $$F(x,y): \RR^2 \to \RR^2$$, then $$F$$ is Fréchet differentiable at $$z_0$$, and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is equal to $$\abs{f'(z_0)}^2$$.

Conversely, we have the following theorem:

**Theorem.** If $$f = u+iv$$ (defined on an open set $$\Omega$$) is such that $$u,v$$ are continuously differentiable and satisfy (1), then $$f$$ is holomorphic on $$\Omega$$, and $$f'(z_0) = \pard{f}{z}$$.


### Integration along curves

A *smooth curve* is a map $$z(t)$$ from a closed interval to $$\CC$$ that is differentiable and such that $$z'(t) \neq 0$$ (in particular, it need not be a smooth map). A *curve* often refers to a piecewise smooth curve. Given a continuous function $$f$$, a smooth curve $$\gamma$$ parametrized by $$z(t): [a,b] \to \CC$$, define

$$ \int_{\gamma} f(z)dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) dt.$$

This depends on $$\gamma$$ but not on the parametrization because of the chain rule. Define the length of $$\gamma$$

$$\abs{\gamma} = \int_a^b \abs{z'(t)} dt,$$

then we must have that

$$\abs{\int_{\gamma} f(z)dz} \le \abs{\gamma} \cdot \sup_{z\in\gamma} \abs{f(z)}.$$

**Theorem.** (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) If a continuous function $$f$$ has a primitive $$F$$ in $$\Omega$$, and $$\gamma$$ is a curve in $$\Omega$$ that begins at $$w_1$$ and ends at $$w_2$$, then

$$\int_{\gamma} f(z)dz = F(w_2) - F(w_1).$$

**Theorem.** If $$f$$ is holomorphic in a region $$\Omega$$ and $$f' = 0$$, then $$f$$ is constant.


## Chapter 2: Cauchy's theorem

### Cauchy's theorem

The discussion above implies that if $$f$$ has a primitive in some open $$\Omega$$, then for any closed curve $$\gamma$$ in $$\Omega$$, 

$$\int_{\gamma} f(z)dz = 0.$$

We will prove a series of results related to this type of expression.

**Theorem.** (Goursat's theorem) If $$f$$ is holomorphic in $$\Omega$$, and $$T\subset\Omega$$ is a triangle whose interior is also inside $$\Omega$$, then

$$\int_{T} f(z)dz = 0.$$

*Proof.* By repeatedly taking midpoints, we create a nested sequence of triangles $$T = T_0 \supset T_1 \supset T_2 \dots$$ such that

$$\abs{\int_{T} f(z)dz} \le 4^n\abs{\int_{T_n} f(z)dz}.$$

The diameters of $$T_n$$ converge to 0, so there exists an unique $$w\in \Omega$$ that lie on or inside all $$T_n$$s. Since $$f$$ is holomorphic at $$w$$, we can write 

$$f(z) = f(w) + f'(w)(z-w) + \phi(z)(z-w)$$

where $$\phi(z)\to 0$$ as $$z\to w$$. Then we can write

$$\abs{\int_{T_n} f(z)dz} = \abs{\int_{T_n} (f(w) + f'(w)(z-w) + \phi(z)(z-w)) dz}.$$

Since the constant and linear terms have primitives, we conclude that

$$\abs{\int_{T_n} f(z)dz} = \abs{\int_{T_n} \phi(z)(z-w) dz} \le 
\abs{T_n}\cdot \sup_{z\in T_n} \abs{\phi(z)(z-w)} \le 4^{-n}\abs{T_0}\cdot \diam(T_0)\cdot \sup_{z\in T_n} \abs{\phi(z)}.$$

Here, $$\abs{T_n}$$ is the perimeter of $$T_n$$. But $$\abs{\phi(z)} \to 0$$ as $$z\to w$$, so

$$\sup_{z\in T_n} \abs{\phi(z)} \to 0$$

as $$n\to\infty$$. This concludes the proof. $$\square$$


**Theorem.** (Cauchy's theorem for a disc) If $$f$$ is holomorphic in a disc, and $$\gamma$$ is a closed curve in that disc, then

$$\int_{\gamma} f(z)dz = 0.$$

*Proof.* We will prove this by showing that $$f$$ has a primitive in that disc, which WLOG we assume to be centered at the origin. For any $$z_0$$ in the disc, let $$\gamma_{z_0}$$ be the polygonal path from 0 to $$z_0$$ where we first go horizontally to $$\Re(z_0)$$ then vertically to $$z_0$$. Now, define

$$F(z_0) = \int_{\gamma_{z_0}} f(z)dz. $$

Using Goursat's theorem and continuity of $$f$$, it is not difficult to show that $$F$$ is in fact a primitive of $$f$$ in the disc. The theorem then follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. $$\square$$

The same proof in fact holds for not just disks, but any contour whose notion of interior is obvious and in which it is easy to construct polygonal paths connecting any two points. Stein & Shakarchi calls them *toy contours*, an important example of which is the *keyhole contour* discussed in the next subsection. 

An important class of applications of Cauchy's theorem is computing lots of definite integrals. Some examples:

- For real $$\xi$$, 

$$e^{-\pi \xi^2} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x^2}e^{-2\pi i x \xi}dx,$$

i.e. $$e^{-\pi x^2}$$ is its own Fourier transform. (Integrate $$e^{-\pi z^2}$$ along the contour $$-R\to R\to R+i\xi \to -R+i\xi \to -R$$)

- $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} dx = \frac{\pi}{2}$$. (Integrate $$\frac{1-e^{iz}}{z^2}$$ along the indented semicircle with radii $$\epsilon\to 0$$ and $$R\to\infty$$)

- Fresnel integerals:

$$\int_0^{\infty} \sin(x^2)dx = \int_0^{\infty} \cos(x^2)dx =  \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{4}.$$

(Integrate $$e^{-z^2}$$ along the sector with angle $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$ and radius $$R$$, then take $$R\to \infty$$)

- $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$. (Integrate $$\frac{e^{iz}-1}{z}$$ along the indented semicircle)


### Cauchy's integral formulas

**Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be holomorphic in an open set that contains the closure of some disc $$D$$. Then for any point $$z_0\in D$$,

$$f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial D} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} dz.$$

*Sketch of proof.* Integrate along the keyhole contour and pass the width of the corridor and the inner circle to 0. $$\square$$

An important and deep consequence of the above theorem:

**Theorem.** (Cauchy integral formula) If $$f$$ is holomorphic in an open $$\Omega$$, then it is infinitely complex differentiable in $$\Omega$$, and for any circle $$C\subset\Omega$$ whose interior is also in $$\Omega$$, for all $$z_0$$ inside $$C$$,

$$\begin{equation} f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} dz. \tag{2} \end{equation}$$

*Proof.* Induct on $$n$$. Suppose that we already have (2) for $$n-1$$. Then

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{h}(f^{n-1}(z_0+h) - f^{n-1}(z_0)) &= \frac{(n-1)!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{h} \pr{\frac{1}{(z-z_0-h)^n} - \frac{1}{(z-z_0)^n}} dz \\
&= \frac{(n-1)!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0-h)(z-z_0)} \pr{\frac{1}{(z-z_0-h)^{n-1}} + \dots + \frac{1}{(z-z_0)^{n-1}}} dz \\
&\to \frac{(n-1)!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^2}\cdot\frac{n}{(z-z_0)^{n-1}} dz \\
&= \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} dz
\end{align*}$$

as $$h\to 0$$. $$\square$$

As an easy corollary:

**Theorem.** (Cauchy inequalities) Let $$f$$ be holomorphic in an open set containing the closure of a disc $$D$$ centered at $$z_0$$ and of radius $$R$$. Then

$$\abs{f^{(n)}(z_0)}\le \frac{n! \norm{f}_C}{R^n},$$

where $$\norm{f}_C = \sup_{z\in \partial D} \abs{f(z)}.$$
