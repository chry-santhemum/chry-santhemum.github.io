The goal of this post is to introduce the Fundamental Theorem of Galois
theory and mention several of its important applications, along the quickest and most direct path. We assume no prior knowledge of field theory besides the very basic definitions.

## Flavors of field extensions

Suppose $E,F$ are fields, such that $F\subseteq E$. We say $E$ is an **extension** of $F$, and we denote this by $E/F$.

For any field extension $E/F$, $E$ is automatically given the structure of a $F$-vector space. Thus, we can talk about the dimension of $E$ as a $F$-vector space; this dimension is called the **degree** of the extension and is written as $[E:F]$. The extension is called **finite** if $[E:F]$ is finite.

### Algebraic extensions

Finite extensions can be easily contructed by adjoining roots of polynomials. For example, adjoining $\sqrt{2}$ to $\QQ$ gives the extension $\QQ(\sqrt{2})/\QQ$, which has degree 2. 

### Splitting fields


### Algebraic closures


### Normal extensions

Let $E/F$ be a field extension. We say the extension is **normal** if the following holds: for any irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$, if it has a root in $E$, then it splits into linear factors over $E$.


### Separable extensions

### Galois extensions

## The Fundamental Theorem


## Solvability by radicals

### Kummer extensions
