You just arrived at an inconspicuous coffee shop on the corner of a rarely-visited street. The sign above you says "The Lost Café". You're not quite sure where this is, as it's pretty clear you've strayed too far away from your destination. But being curious as always, you decide to take a look.

The door closes behind you as you step inside the warm, inviting air. You see people reading books, making pencil drawings, chatting in low voices. The barista looks at you and acknowledges your presence, then resumes to his work. You walk down the array of small, wooden tables and pick the nearest unoccupied one. You realize you've been walking nonstop for the entire day; sitting down on a chair now makes you realize how tired you are.

You look at the menu on the wall. You're slightly disappointed because your favorite cinnamon pumpkin oat milk iced latte is not on there, not even your second-favorite whipped cream marshmallow hot chocolate. Well, what can you do? So you choose to order a simple cappuccino, hoping that it at least has a pretty foam. It certainly doesn't –– just a plain old layer of tiny brownish-grey air bubbles. Well, at least it's still hot, and your hands are still really, really cold.

Now with the caffeine circulating in your blood, you feel considerably more invigorated. It's getting dark outside, and why not stay a little longer? More people are shuffling in from both ends of the corridor, looking somewhat happy and excited. It's the anticipation that matters, the hope that there's always a possibility for things to go better. The barista now announces the arrival of some Very Important guests, saying something like:

"Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome everybody's favorite band from Kepler 452b, The Lost Café, for their extraordinary performance tonight!"
