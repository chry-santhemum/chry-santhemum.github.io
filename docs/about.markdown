You just arrived at an inconspicuous coffee shop on the corner of a rarely-visited street. The sign above you says "The Lost Caf√©". You're not quite sure where this is, as it's pretty clear you've strayed too far away from your destination. But being curious as always, you decide to take a look.

The door closes behind you as you step inside the warm, inviting atmosphere. You see people reading books, making pencil drawings, chatting in low voices. The barista looks at you and acknowledges your presence, then resumes to his work. You walk down the array of small, wooden tables and pick the nearest unoccupied one. You realize that you've been walking for the entire day; finally sitting down on a chair fills you with vigor and determination.
